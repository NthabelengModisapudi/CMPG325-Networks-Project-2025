## Project Overview
### Project Objectives
CMPG 325 individual semester-long project Computer Networks aims to demonstrate comprehensive understanding of network design, implementation, and management through hands-on simulation using Cisco Packet Tracer. The primary objectives are:
-Design and implement five fundamental network topologies: Bus, Mesh, Star, Ring, and Extended Star
-Create and configure a hybrid topology that creatively integrates elements from multiple basic topologies

Implement dual-stack networking with both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing schemes

Configure network segmentation using VLAN technology

Deploy and manage network services including HTTP web server, DNS, and DHCP

Implement enterprise-grade wireless security using WPA3 protocol

Document the entire process comprehensively on GitHub with proper version control

Demonstrate functionality through a professional video presentation

1.2 Project Deliverables
